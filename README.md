# Golden-Elm
 I created this website as a junior in my Web Design class for the fictional furniture company, Golden Elm.
 First, I designed the wireframes using Adobe XD. Then, I edited photos and created graphics using Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator.
 I coded the website in Sublime Text using HTML and CSS. </br> </br>
